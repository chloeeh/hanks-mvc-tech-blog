# wk14 - hanks-mvc-tech-blog


## Description

The purpose of this project is to invoke Express, mySQL2, and sequelize packages in javascript to develop a functional fullstack application for a tech blog

- Insomnia is used to organize the GET, PUT, POST, DELETE routes. Ideally, one would have both a functional backend and frontend, allowing a user to login, but alas! This was a rushed job simply to submit an assignment, so I could focus on Project 02, a higher priority.

Basically, nothing works. An attempt was made to troubleshoot at least the routes, but no. So...anyway.

- The package.json file includes a script to run the code automatically instead of using node server.js in conjunction with npm start, etc.

- The .env file is included in the .gitignore to protect my credentials. For those perusing this readme, make sure you create your own .env for database, user, password

## Installation

From the command line, run:

- npm init

- npm install mysql2

- npm install sequelize

- npm install express

- npm install dotenv

- npm install bcrypt

- npm run start

## Usage

Don't use it; unusable
